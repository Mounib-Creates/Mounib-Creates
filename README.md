## 👋 Hi there, I'm Mounib!

I'm a Computer Science student with a growing passion for cloud computing, DevOps, and systems engineering. What started as curiosity has become a journey of continuous learning, hands-on experimentation, and real-world project building.

### 🧠 What I'm learning:
- **Cloud & DevOps:** AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions
- **Systems & Scripting:** Linux, networking, shell scripting, system fundamentals
- **Development Tools:** Git, Python, Java, databases, monitoring tools

### 🚀 What I’ve built:
- CI/CD pipelines to streamline development and deployment
- Containerized apps deployed on Kubernetes clusters
- Automated AWS infrastructure setup using the AWS CLI

### 💬 What I value:
Collaboration, problem-solving, and learning by doing. I'm the kind of teammate who’ll debug by your side and share every step of the journey.
